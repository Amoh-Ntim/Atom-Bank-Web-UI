# Atom Bank Web App Documentation

## Introduction
Atom Bank is a web application developed at Zap Technology by me. It's built using React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. The application serves as a online digital banking platform.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v14.0.0 or above
- npm v6.0.0

### Installation
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/Amoh-Ntim/atom-bank.git`
2. Install NPM packages: `npm install`

## Usage
To start the development server, run `npm run dev`.

## Application Structure

### React Components
- `App`: This is the root component of the application.
- `Navbar Components`: This component folder displays both navbars for the smaller and bigger screens.
- `Hero`: This component folder contains all the various hero divisions.

### Vite Configuration
The Vite configuration is located in the `vite.config.js` file. I have configured Vite to use the React preset and enabled absolute imports.

### Tailwind CSS
We're using Tailwind CSS for styling our components. We've customized our color palette in the `tailwind.config.js` file.

## Testing
Run `npm test` to execute the test suite.

## Deployment
The application is deployed on Vercel. To deploy your own version, connect your repository to Vercel and it will be deployed automatically on each push.
